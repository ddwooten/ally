Welcome to Daniel Wooten's Data Challenge submission! You've started at the
right place!

First, a brief tour. In keeping with tradition all source code files are found
inside of the src/ directory. However, the top level of the src/ directory
contains all the unit, integration, and system testing files as well as a
directory, source/ which contains the actual source code, class files, etc.
This convention is to allow for test driven development in Python without the
user needing to modify their system just to run this small testing package.
The docs/ directory is the next place you should visit! Inside there are two
sub-directories; um/ and api/. um/ is where you can find the user manual, a
helpful guide on how to use the iss_system_status code ( ISS for short ). Inside
of the api/ sub-directory you will find the applications user interface 
document, api.pdf, which contains a more technical nuts-and-bolts look at the 
internals of iss and how it works.

As far as licensure, this work is covered under the Eclipse Public Licence.
