Introduction

###############################################################################


Welcome to Daniel Wooten's Data Challenge submission! You've started at the
right place!

First, a brief tour. 

1. The directory src/ contains all the source code files* for the whole project.

2. The directory docs/ contains three subdirectories; html/, latex/, and UM/.
UM/ contains the user manual, a pdf where you can find more detailed
information and instructions pertaining to this package. The html/ and latex/
subdirectories contain html and latex version, respectively, of the API for this
package. Opening the file 'index.html' in your favorite browser will allow you
to navigate through the documentation. If you are familar with latex you may
with to investgate that folder. 

3. The file Doxygen is a set-up file for the automatic documentaiton generation
engine Doxygen - there is no need for you to interact with this file.

* To enable test driven development without too much aditional set up on the 
user's part to run said tests, python requires a slightly skewed directory
structure from the convention. The src/ directory does contain all source code
files for the whole project. On the first level it contains testing files and
infrastructure. On this level you will find a subdirectory called source/, it
is inside of this directory where the actual exectuable and source code may
be found. Python pathin necessitates that these files be in a sub-directory of
the test directory.
