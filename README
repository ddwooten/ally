Introduction

###############################################################################


Welcome to Daniel Wooten's Data Challenge submission! You've started at the
right place!

First, a brief tour. 

1. The directory src/ contains all the source code files* for the whole project.

2. The directory docs/ contains three subdirectories; html/, latex/, and UM/.
UM/ contains the user manual, a pdf where you can find more detailed
information and instructions pertaining to this package. The html/ and latex/
subdirectories contain html and latex version, respectively, of the API for this
package. Opening the file 'index.html' in your favorite browser will allow you
to navigate through the documentation. If you are familiar with latex you may
with to investigate that folder. 

3. The file Doxygen is a set-up file for the automatic documentation generation
engine Doxygen - there is no need for you to interact with this file.

* To enable test driven development without too much additional set up on the 
user's part to run said tests, python requires a slightly skewed directory
structure from the convention. The src/ directory does contain all source code
files for the whole project. On the first level it contains testing files and
infrastructure. On this level you will find a subdirectory called source/, it
is inside of this directory where the actual executable and source code may
be found. Python testing necessitates that these files be in a subdirectory of
the test directory.

Installation

###############################################################################

The following python packages must be installed on your system and locatable on
your PYTHONPATH environment variable...

1. sys
2. os
3. urllib
4. json
5. math
6. datetime
7. ephem
8. calendar
9. redis
10. time

The following programs must be installed on your system and located on your
PATH environment variable...

1. redis-server

Once the above dependencies have been installed on your system and this package
is as well, go into the source/ subdirectory found inside of the src/ directory
and adjust the permissions of the 'main.py' file to be executable. 

IMPORTANT!!!
Last but not, lease open the 'main.py' file and replace the existing file path 
found there with the path to your system's Python 3 interpreter.

Congratulations!! You have successfully installed the ISS Check Status Engine!

Quick Use 

###############################################################################

 loc:

	From the command line execute the following command...

	./main.py loc

	...to retrieve and print to stdout the current latitude and longitude 
	of the ISS. 

 people:

	From the command line execute the following command...

	./main.py people 

	...to retrieve and print to stdout the current crew roster of the ISS.

 pass:

	From the command line execute the following command...

	./main.py pass [latitude] [longitude]  

	...to retrieve and print to stdout when and for how long the ISS will be
        overhead of the coordinates specified by [latitude] and [longitude]. 
	[latitude] should be a floating point number in the range of [-90, 90].
	[longitude] should be a floating point number in the range of
	[-180, 180].
